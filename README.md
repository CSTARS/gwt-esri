GWT wrapper for the ESRI Javascipt API

Currently able to run on 3.4 of the esri js api.

~~The older version of the code can still be found here: https://code.google.com/p/gwt-esri/~~  Looks like google code is going to bed.

Javadocs can now be found here on Github [http://cstars.github.io/gwt-esri/](http://cstars.github.io/gwt-esri/)
